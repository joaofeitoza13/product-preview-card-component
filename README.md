Hi there 👋, I’m João and this is my solution for this challenge. 🚀

🛠️ Built With:

- HTML and CSS only;

📚 New stuff tried:

- Mobile-first approach;
- Grid;
- **BEM** naming convention;
- More use of semantic tags;
- Thought of using **.woff2** instead of **.tff**, decided to use **GoogleAPI** but leave the woff2 files inside assets;
- More intense use of variables, I used vars only on colors in previous challenges;
- [Reset CSS](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)
- **Hidden elements** for improved accessibility in prices text.
- Specificity pseudo-class **:is** to group **:hover** and **:focus**
- **Data attribute** to add the shopping cart to the button

🎯 Stuff to try in future projects:
- CSS Preprocessor or Framework

Any feedback or suggestions on how I can improve and reduce unnecessary code are welcome!

Thank you!
